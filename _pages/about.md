My name is Eray Sevgen. I am a Geomatics Engineer, GIS specialist and researcher. My current interests are geospatial data management and machine and deep learning for 3D point clouds. I am working for a public company in the GIS department in Ankara, Turkey. 

I obtained my degrees from several universities from Turkey and USA. I had a Ph.D. in Geomatics Engineering from Hacettepe University, Ankara. In my Ph.D. I studied 3D point cloud classification with machine learning focusing on deep learning. I earned a M.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA studing road extraction from GPS trajectories. I had a B.Sc. in Geomatics Engineering from Yıldız Technical University, Istanbul.
