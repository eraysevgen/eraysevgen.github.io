ABSTRACT = {Automatic point cloud classification (PCC) is a challenging task in large-scale urban point clouds due to the heterogeneous density of points, the high number of points and the incomplete set of objects. Although recent PCC studies rely on automatic feature extraction through deep learning (DL), there is still a gap for traditional machine learning (ML) models with hand-crafted features, particularly after emerging gradient boosting machine (GBM) methods. In this study, we are using the traditional ML framework for the problem of PCC in large-scale datasets following the steps of neighborhood definition, multi-scale feature extraction, and classification. Different from others, our framework takes advantage of the fast feature calculation with multi-scale radius neighborhood and a recent state-of-the-art GBM classifier, LightGBM. We tested our framework using three mobile urban datasets, Paris–Rau–Madame, Paris–Rue–Cassette and Toronto3D. According to the results, our framework outperforms traditional machine learning models and competes with DL-based methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Prediction of possible landslide areas is the first stage of landslide hazard mitigation efforts and is also crucial for suitable site selection. Several statistical and machine learning methodologies have been applied for the production of landslide susceptibility maps. However, the performance assessment of such methods have conventionally been carried out by utilizing existing landslide inventories. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performances of landslide susceptibility maps produced with three different machine learning algorithms, i.e., random forest, artificial neural network, and logistic regression, in a recently constructed and activated dam reservoir and assess the external quality of each map by using pre- and post-event photogrammetric datasets. The methodology introduced here was applied using digital surface models generated from aerial photogrammetric flight data acquired before and after the dam construction. Aerial photogrammetric images acquired in 2012 and 2018 (after the dam was filled) were used to produce digital terrain models and orthophotos. The 2012 dataset was used for producing the landslide susceptibility maps and the results were evaluated by comparing the Euclidian distances between the two surface models. The results show that the random forest method outperforms the other two for predicting the future landslides.},
